## Project Overview

The **OOM Project** was an academic endeavor focused on mastering **object-oriented modeling**, **UML design**, and robust **software architecture**. 
Developed as part of my coursework at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, this project reflects a formal, methodical approach to designing scalable and maintainable software systems.


## What It Covers

- **Use Case Diagrams** outlining key system interactions and user stories  
- **Class Diagrams** illustrating entity relationships, inheritance structures, and interfaces  
- **Sequence Diagrams** showing workflow across objects and system components  
- **Design Principles** including SOLID, encapsulation, and separation of concerns  
- Structured documentation that clearly links requirements, design decisions, and future implementation steps  

Through this project, I demonstrated not only my grasp of theoretical modeling, but also my ability to translate complex ideas into structured, reusable architectural diagrams.

## Key Skills & Learnings

- **Clear Visual Communication**: Modeling software behavior in a way that's immediately understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
- **Scalable Design Thinking**: Planning systems with maintainability and extensibility in mind—anticipating changes and new features.  
- **Academic Rigor**: Applying formal UML standards and thoughtful documentation to produce design assets that are ready for implementation or peer review.  


## Why It Matters for My Portfolio

In professional projects, strong system design provides the foundation for efficient coding and easy collaboration. This OOM project demonstrates my commitment to clean architecture, thoughtful planning, and structured analysis—skills that translate seamlessly into real-world software development environments.
