## Introduction

From 2018 to 2019 I attended a course in school where a group of seven people were tasked with the creation of a game.  
The group was split into three programmers, three artists, and one composer.  
We decided on a **low poly, open world, medieval-themed RPG**, combining stylized visuals with role-playing mechanics.

## What We Built

The final project lacked a complete narrative but included a surprising number of fully functional systems:  

- A real-time combat system
- A working inventory and equipment system
- An open world environment designed to be explorable  
- Dynamic environmental music that responded to player location  

Despite being a school project, the team successfully delivered a playable prototype that demonstrated our creativity and technical abilities.

## My Contributions

I incorporated several systems into the game, including:  

- **Inventory and Equipment Management** – allowed players to collect, equip, and use items.  
- **Environmental Music System** – adaptive audio that set the mood depending on the location or situation.  
- **Animation Graph** – blending and managing character animations for smooth transitions.  
- **Combat System** – implemented core mechanics for melee fighting.  
- **Level Design** – contributed to creating and shaping the explorable world.  

This gave me the opportunity to work hands-on with **Unity’s animation system**, **C# scripting**, and **level design tools**.

## Key Takeaways

This project was my first large-scale collaborative effort in game development, and it taught me several valuable lessons:

- **Collaboration & Teamwork** – working alongside artists, composers, and other programmers showed me how different disciplines come together in a single project.  
- **Project Management** – we had to split tasks, align on a shared vision, and overcome the challenges of coordinating a diverse team.  
- **Technical Growth** – I gained practical experience in Unity, especially with animation, game mechanics, and data structures for inventory management.  
- **Creativity & Problem Solving** – finding ways to balance scope with feasibility in a limited timeframe was a key challenge that pushed me to think critically.  

While the game wasn’t feature-complete, it was a milestone in my journey as a developer. It strengthened my passion for game development and gave me a foundation to build more complex projects later on.
