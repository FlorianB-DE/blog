On September 22–23, 2025, I had the honor to participate in the **BIM-Portal Hackathon** in Berlin. Over two intense days, 13 teams from across Germany came together under one mission: to prototype solutions around the BIM portal’s REST API and advance digital transformation in the construction sector.

Our event venue was at the **Federal Ministry for Transportation (BMV)**, where participants with expertise in architecture, construction, IT, and geodesy collaborated on five different challenge tracks. The participants came from diverse backgrounds — ranging from start-ups and universities to established companies and long-time BIM experts with many years of professional experience.

## Challenges & Objectives

The hackathon was structured around five thematic challenges:  
- Model Checking  
- Enrichment of BIM Models  
- Definition / Generation of Information Requirements  
- Software Integration with the BIM Portal  
- Innovative Solutions for the Construction Sector  

Mentors from academia, industry, and public administration guided the teams. Each team had about 24 hours to design, build, and pitch a working prototype.

## First Place: Team *ScrumMasters*

I’m thrilled to share that our team — **Andreas Haffa, Robin Ov, Dennis Sippel, Ayman Soultana, Justus Weyers, and myself** — won **1st place**.

Our submission integrated an AI-based model checking component designed to help with the validation of BIM models, a *CoPilot* for the civil industry. The jury praised especially the **technical feasibility** and **clear practical benefit** it would bring to real-world workflows.  

Working late into the night, we managed to deliver a prototype that convinced both mentors and the jury. I’m deeply proud of our collective effort, the synergy we built, and the results we achieved together.  

## Other Winning Teams

Congratulations to both teams!

## Ceremony & Broader Impact

The award was handed over by **Verena Hubertz**, Minister for Housing, Urban Development and Building. Her words underscored the importance of innovation, collaboration, and digitalization in the construction sector and we had a good laugh about our team name.  

More than just a competition, the hackathon was a platform for **knowledge exchange**, networking, and cross-disciplinary inspiration. I left Berlin with fresh ideas, new contacts, and a reinforced drive to push digital transformation forward in construction.
